/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

*/

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne = (stringOne.length);   // Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo = (stringTwo.length);   // Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree = (stringThree.length); // Length of stringThree

// Your code here
console.log(lengthOne); //returns 15, this is correct
console.log(lengthTwo); //returns 10, this is correct
console.log(lengthThree); //returns 0, I believe this is correct since there is no space in the quotation marks
